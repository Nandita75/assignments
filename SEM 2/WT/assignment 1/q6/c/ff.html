<p>Inline (Floating) Frames Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 introduced a feature called inline frames (also called floating frames), which are identified with the iframe tag.
They enable a scrollable frame to be placed anywhere within the flow of an HTML document, much like an image. 
Placing an inline frame is similar to placing an image on a page.Iframe tag specify the width and height of the frame and the HTML file you want it to display. As with images, you can align the frame on the page and specify hspace and vspace. As with frames, you can specify margins within the frame and border display.</p>
